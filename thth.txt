Fans keep arguing over if Thranduil (http://evankart.deviantart.com/art/Thranduil-419996946) or Thorin (http://evankart.deviantart.com/art/Thorin-Oakenshield-420365763) makes the better [... sassier] king.

For some reason, Bard (the Bowman [first King of Dale]) does not seem to get the same attention.
