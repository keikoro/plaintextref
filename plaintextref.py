# check file type of file input via cli
# differentiate between:
#   plain text (.txt)
#   HTML (.htm, .html)
#   Markdown (.md)
#
# loop through all lines of the file
# search for occurrences of brackets in each line
# use round brackets only if they contain URLs of any kind (://)
# use all square brackets
#
# remove any whitespace preceding the brackets
# replace each pair of brackets with [i]
# where i is a counter that gets incremented
#
# save contents of brackets in a dictionary (?) 
# with counter variable serving as key
#
# add two new lines at end of file
# and output the dictionary sorted by keys (ascending)
# like so: [key] dictionarycontent
#
